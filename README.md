#Overview

LandProcessor is a GIS tool for representing landcapes into connected homogeneous spatial units. It is developped for the BVservice project and is mainly focused on surface hydrology in agricultural landscapes. Resulting connected spatial units are distributed into classes : SU (Surface Units such as plots), LI (Linear Interfaces such as hedges or benches), RS (Reach Segments such as ditches or rivers).


#Building from sources

##Requirements

LandProcessor is written in C++11 and is intented to run on Linux platforms.
The following tools and frameworks are also required:
- GCC 4.9 or higher
- CMake 2.8.12 or higher
- OpenFLUID 2.1.3 or higher
- Boost 1.54 or higher
- GDAL 1.11
- Qt 4.8.x

##Building and testing

To build from sources, execute the following commands in the source tree using a terminal 
```
mkdir _build
cd _build
cmake ..
make
```
To run the provided tests, execute the following commands from the `_build` directory using a terminal:
```
mkdir _build
cd _build
ctest
make
```

#TODO

- [ ] Remove absolute paths for temporary files, use openfluid::base::Environment::getTempDir() instead
- [ ] Introduce install and packaging using CPack in CMake configuration
- [ ] Improve management of input and output for easier implementation of 2 stages processing
- [ ] Refactor main source code to be more easily maintainable
- [Â ] Introduce correct land use codes in tests
- [ ] Improve performance by moving invariants out of loops
